The most crucial question is: what happened at the moment of the Big Bang? According to the most widely accepted theory, the Universe simply arises from nothing, as quantum mechanics allows for such an occurrence, albeit with very low probability. Thus, the Universe emerged from nothing. But if the Universe can emerge from nothing, why couldn’t a human brain emerge from nothing in the same way?</p><figure name="3ba8" id="3ba8" class="graf graf--figure graf--iframe graf-after--p"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OpohbXB_JZU?feature=oembed" width="700" height="393" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></figure><p name="24ef" id="24ef" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">This is the essence of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boltzmann_brain" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boltzmann_brain" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Boltzmann Brain Theory</a>. What if you, dear reader, are a brain that emerged from nothing? This brain was created at this very moment and contains all the memories you have experienced. You believe that you have lived for many years, but in reality, you were born at this moment, and all your memories are false. Moreover, there is a good chance that in the next moment, you will be swallowed up by the nothingness from which you emerged. Can you prove in any way that you are not such a Boltzmann brain? It’s a crazy and terrifying theory, isn’t it? The theory of a Universe emerging from nothing is much more believable than a brain emerging from nothing. But there is a little problem. Our current universe is full of brains.</p><p name="4019" id="4019" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The second law of thermodynamics states that the disorder (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_%28classical_thermodynamics%29" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(classical_thermodynamics)" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">entropy</a>) of an isolated system will increase over time. This principle is so fundamental in our lives that many people might not even be aware of it, but it is the reason, for example, that an egg can become scrambled eggs, but we never see scrambled eggs suddenly reassemble into an egg. Ludwig Boltzmann explained the continuous increase in entropy by stating that randomly moving particles always have many more disordered arrangements available to them than ordered ones, which is why the entire system is much more likely to end up in a disordered state than an ordered one. Since the Universe is also an isolated system, it follows that its entropy is constantly increasing as well. This implies that at the beginning of the world, the Universe was in a “super-ordered” state.</p><p name="ac3e" id="ac3e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There are billions of people on Earth, each with their own brain and consciousness. Since the universe has existed for billions of years, it is currently in a much more disordered (higher entropy) state than at the beginning of time. We also know that the more complex something is, the less likely it is to emerge from nothing. Based on this, it is much more probable for a brain to emerge from nothing than for a universe with galaxies, solar systems, and billions of brains to do so. Therefore, purely on a statistical basis, it is much more likely that we are Boltzmann brains and that the universe is merely an illusion to us rather than the entire universe had arisen from nothing.</p><p name="b7bc" id="b7bc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Of course, one could argue that these billions of brains didn’t just emerge from nothing. The Universe started from a single point and has been continuously expanding. During this process, stars and galaxies formed, as well as solar systems with planets where life could develop. The development of the brain is the result of millions of years of evolution. The evolution of our brains is due to simple physical laws and countless random events, which is not comparable to simply emerging from nothing. However, there is a response to this argument, which I call the <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Soft Boltzmann Brain Theory.</strong></p><p name="719e" id="719e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Imagine that the world, similar to our current universe, begins with a Big Bang. However, as a result of continuous expansion, instead of stars and galaxies, a structure capable of computation forms. We can call it a brain, but if that’s confusing, we can consider it some sort of primitive life form. Over time, this entity evolves and develops self-awareness. We can view this as a kind of <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">abstract evolution</strong>. It is abstract because, instead of living beings, it is thoughts that compete with each other. Essentially, the entity exists in a state of continuous dreaming. It couldn’t do much else but dream since nothing else exists outside of it, as it is the entire Universe itself. At a certain stage of development, this unified consciousness splits into many parallel consciousnesses, somewhat like cell division. Such a form of Soft Boltzmann Brain is not much different from our Universe.</p><p name="c724" id="c724" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The Universe as we know it emerged from nothing. Its functioning is governed by fundamental physical laws, and life developed over a long time thanks to evolution. Strangely, our Universe is fine-tuned for life. If any physical constant were even slightly different from what it is now, the intelligent life we know could not have developed. The most accepted explanation for this fine-tuning is that there are countless universes, each with different physical constants. We perceive our universe as fine-tuned because it is the only one we know. This is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropic_principle" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropic_principle" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">anthropic principle</a>.</p><p name="fdf1" id="fdf1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A Soft Boltzmann Brain also emerges from nothing. Initially, it is not intelligent and its functioning is governed by simple physical laws, similar to our Universe. Since this Boltzmann Brain is incapable of perceiving the outside world (because there is no outside world), it exists in a continuous dream state. When it becomes self-aware and then splits into many consciousnesses, it begins to examine itself and finds that the Universe (which it hallucinates) is fine-tuned for life, which is obvious since it created it for itself. The distant stars and galaxies are all parts of the hallucination, making this a much smaller and simpler structure than our currently known Universe. Therefore, theoretically, it is more likely for such a structure to emerge from nothing than our currently known (wasteful) Universe.</p><p name="bec4" id="bec4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Is it possible that we are actually parts of such a Soft Boltzmann Brain? If we think about it, there is really no way to refute this. Any experiment we conduct in the world we hallucinate for ourselves will appear to be a reality since we cannot outsmart our own minds. A few years ago, I wrote an entire article on why it is impossible to prove that the world we know is a hallucination.</p><div name="b755" id="b755" class="graf graf--mixtapeEmbed graf-after--p"><a href="https://medium.com/geekculture/our-universe-is-a-massive-neural-network-heres-why-a0d5a5787230" data-href="https://medium.com/geekculture/our-universe-is-a-massive-neural-network-heres-why-a0d5a5787230" class="markup--anchor markup--mixtapeEmbed-anchor" title="https://medium.com/geekculture/our-universe-is-a-massive-neural-network-heres-why-a0d5a5787230"><strong class="markup--strong markup--mixtapeEmbed-strong">Our Universe Is A Massive Neural Network: Here’s Why</strong><br><em class="markup--em markup--mixtapeEmbed-em">Some days ago, I read an article on arXiv from Vitaly Vanchurin about ‘The world as a neural network’.</em>medium.com</a><a href="https://medium.com/geekculture/our-universe-is-a-massive-neural-network-heres-why-a0d5a5787230" class="js-mixtapeImage mixtapeImage u-ignoreBlock" data-media-id="81a946bbc73f67b3dccd9437e281e029" data-thumbnail-img-id="0*B72UaSoWAMvL6lzE" style="background-image: url(https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/160/160/0*B72UaSoWAMvL6lzE);"></a></div><p name="32f6" id="32f6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--mixtapeEmbed">The Boltzmann Brain Theory is a type of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation_hypothesis" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation_hypothesis" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Simulation Hypothesis</a>. According to the Simulation Hypothesis, the reality we know is just a simulation created by a civilization with more advanced technology, much like in the movie “The Matrix.” The Simulation Hypothesis can provide answers to things like the fine-tuning of the Universe, but as a creation theory, it is not as strong since it simply pushes the problem to a higher level. We get an answer to where our Universe comes from, but a new question arises: where do those who created the simulation come from?</p><blockquote name="7a50" id="7a50" class="graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p">The Soft Boltzmann Brain theory provides a simple answer to the most important question of the Simulation Hypothesis, namely, who built the computer running the simulation. According to the theory, the computer emerged from nothing, just as the currently accepted scientific theories suggest the Universe itself did. In this case, the words “computer” and “brain” are obviously interchangeable.</blockquote><p name="4a69" id="4a69" class="graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote">There has been only one argument successfully raised against the Boltzmann Brain Theory, which Sean Carroll calls “cognitive instability.” In a nutshell, the argument is that if the Universe as we know it is actually just a hallucination of a Boltzmann Brain, then we cannot use the laws observed here to explain the “external” world, as we cannot know anything about it. For example, it is possible that the second law of thermodynamics does not hold in the “external” world, so we cannot use it to explain the Boltzmann Brain universe. This, of course, does not rule out the possibility that we are indeed parts of a Boltzmann Brain; it merely states that we cannot use the second law of thermodynamics to argue in favor of it.</p><p name="7dd3" id="7dd3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If we live in such a Soft Boltzmann Brain universe, then essentially every person is the same individual, somewhat like in Andy Weir’s story “The Egg.”</p><figure name="a923" id="a923" class="graf graf--figure graf--iframe graf-after--p"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/D1VN5zICGeU?feature=oembed" width="700" height="393" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></figure><p name="818c" id="818c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">The idea of a Soft Boltzmann Brain Universe is very similar to Donald Hoffmann’s Universe. According to Hoffmann, consciousness is fundamental, and the reality we consider objective is merely an illusion. In reality, the Universe is a collection of conscious agents organized into a hierarchy. Human consciousness is located somewhere in the middle of this hierarchy, so our perceived independence from each other is also an illusion. In truth, we are parts of a single unified consciousness. Just like in Andy Weir’s story.</p><figure name="165d" id="165d" class="graf graf--figure graf--iframe graf-after--p"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CmieNQH7Q4w?feature=oembed" width="700" height="393" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></figure><p name="deef" id="deef" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">It’s hard not to notice that the Soft Boltzmann Brain Theory resembles a concept of God, as the Soft Boltzmann Brain, like God, has existed since the beginning of time and is omnipotent.</p><blockquote name="7a06" id="7a06" class="graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p">According to the Soft Boltzmann Brain Theory’s concept, God is not separate from us. We are one with it.</blockquote><p name="99af" id="99af" class="graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote">Of course, I would rather leave theological speculations to the theologians. What might be even more interesting is what a society would look like where the moral foundations stem from the belief that the world is a Soft Boltzmann Brain and we are all one. With such an attitude and much less ego, the world might be a much happier and more sustainable place.</p><p name="5d94" id="5d94" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Many experts believe that sooner or later, we will reach the state of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Singularity_Is_Near" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Singularity_Is_Near" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">technological singularity</a>. According to Ray Kurzweil, we will be able to simulate the human brain on a computer. Once technology reaches this point, we will no longer need a physical body, just a computer running our consciousness. Over time, we might transform the entire solar system into a single gigantic computer, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrioshka_brain" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrioshka_brain" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Matrioshka brain</strong></a>. Many scientists take this theory so seriously that they believe it explains why we don’t find evidence of intelligent extraterrestrial life forms. The reason we don’t find aliens is because we’re looking for them in the wrong way. Instead of searching for habitable planets, we should be looking for these Matrioshka brains. If an alien species visits us in the distant future, they will find a single giant brain with many more or less separate consciousnesses living in it, exactly like a Soft Boltzmann Brain.</p><p name="c74c" id="c74c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">It is conceivable that in the distant future, humanity will exist as a single giant mind, but it is also possible that we already exist this way. Although we have not learned more about the world around us, after understanding the Boltzmann Brain Theory, we may look at it a little differently. Either way, such contemplation is always exciting and fun. I hope you feel the same way by the end of this article. Happy pondering…</p></div></div></section>

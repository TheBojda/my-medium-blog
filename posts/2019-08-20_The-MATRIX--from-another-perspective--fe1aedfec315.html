Environment pollution and overconsumption of the resources have irreversibly changed the million years ecosystem. Leaders of the world have done nothing to stop the cataclysm. They were blinded by the money and the power, and people were also blinded by the empty promises. Finally, the smog overshadowed the sun, the earth becomes barren, famine and misery spread all over the world. Because of the extreme weather, more and more places become uninhabitable, many countries have collapsed, and wars have begun. We made the Earth hell, but most of the people were still repeating: “It’s not our fault!”</p><p name="2aea" id="2aea" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">The technology was our very last hope. A consortium of the world biggest tech companies has found the solution. They have developed the full-immersive virtual reality and built the world largest VR network. It was the MATRIX. The MATRIX was free and open for everyone. If somebody wanted to join, he or she got a capsule after a short, robotized brain surgery. The capsule contained the full life support system, and it was connected to the whole network. There was no famine and misery, and there were no diseases in the MATRIX. People lived in abundance. It was something like heaven. But people’s lives became empty in a perfect world. They needed goals and problems what they can solve. They decided to erase their memory and start a new life in a world of the 90s. In this new world, they have to work for everything, but they were happy again. Most of the humans lived in the MATRIX, except for a small group of people. They lived under the ground in Zion. Zion was the hell itself. They lived in misery and eat the same tasteless protein cocktail day by day. They hated the technology of the MATRIX because they think, it is a fake world, a lie. They invented a weird story about the machines that kidnap people to use them as an energy source. The story was obviously false because machines could use nuclear or fusion power, but they believed it. They were sick people from an old, sick world. For a while, the two world lived side by side in peace, until a group of self-proclaimed heroes tried to “rescue” the people from the MATRIX. This is the story of them…</p></div></div></section>
